# Managed Preferences (macOS)

Administrators can use macOS MDM Managed Preferences to provide server URLs to
Omnigent Desktop. People can then choose their organization’s server instead of
typing it.

The preference domain is the desktop bundle identifier:

```text
ai.omnigent.desktop
```

## Keys

| Key                                 | Type             | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `serverUrls`                        | Array of strings | No       | `[]`    | Server URLs to offer, most-preferred first. Each must use `https://`. At most 10.                                                               |
| `databricksInternalFeaturesEnabled` | Boolean          | No       | `false` | Defaults macOS apps to V2 onboarding and enables Databricks-internal features on supported servers. Only an explicit boolean `true` enables it. |

A schemeless host is accepted and interpreted as `https://`. Paths are
preserved, so an administrator can provide a workspace mount directly:

```text
https://my-workspace.cloud.databricks.com/ml/omnigents
```

Entries with the same origin are collapsed, keeping the first. An invalid type,
an insecure or malformed entry, or more than 10 entries rejects the whole list.

To give a server a display name, add an `omnigentServerName` query parameter
to its entry. Omnigent removes the parameter before connecting:

```text
https://my-workspace.cloud.databricks.com/?o=123&omnigentServerName=Engineering
```

Encode spaces as `%20`, and write `&` as `&amp;` inside a plist. Unnamed servers
show their host. The first managed server's name labels the connect screen's
**Join your team** button; names also label the organization's servers in its
dropdown and in the in-app server switcher.

## Behavior

Managed servers appear under **Provided by your organization** on the connect
screen and in the in-app server switcher. They are offered, not enforced:

- Omnigent does not connect automatically.
- People can still enter another server URL.
- Managed values are read from macOS on demand rather than copied wholesale
  into `settings.json`.
- A managed workspace path is loaded as configured instead of being reduced to
  its origin.

Applying or removing a profile is reflected the next time the server switcher
is opened or the connect screen is loaded.

## Databricks-internal features

When `databricksInternalFeaturesEnabled` is `true`, macOS apps, including unpackaged
development, default to V2 onboarding for new and existing profiles. This does not require
`serverUrls` or a connected server. An explicit selector choice still wins,
and saved servers still reconnect on launch. Other platforms
keep the legacy default; `OMNIGENT_SERVER_SELECTOR_V2=1` still
forces V2.

When `databricksInternalFeaturesEnabled` is `true` **and** the window is
connected to a Databricks-managed server (a workspace mount on
`*.databricks.com` / `*.azuredatabricks.net`, or a Databricks App on
`*.databricksapps.com`, https only), the new-session host picker offers
**Run on Arca**: connecting the user's Arca dev instance to the current
server as a host. On any other server the Arca option is disabled. Selecting it
opens a shell-owned connect console that shows the exact command — `arca ssh`
with a remote `isaac omni host --background --non-interactive` — and, after
confirmation, streams the command's live output into an embedded terminal
pane; the instance authenticates with its own Databricks credentials. A
connect already in flight is re-surfaced (console focused, outcome shared)
rather than refused, and the run has a hard timeout so a wedged connection
always settles. No local process outlives the connect — the enrolled host
keeps its own outbound tunnel from the Arca box. Once connected, the option
disappears and the box's host row is tagged **Arca instance** (recognized by
the host id remembered at connect time). Like the server list, the flag is read from
macOS on demand, so profile changes apply without a restart.

Remote hosts need their own renewable **Omnigent** OAuth grant. Desktop browser
sign-in and generic Arca credentials do not replace it. During explicit runner
setup, an authentication-required result starts `isaac omni login <server-url>`
on Arca and retries the noninteractive host command once after sign-in. The
manual connect console asks **Sign in and retry** before doing the same.
Arca Companion opens the browser and routes its callback to the remote CLI;
tokens and login output are not forwarded to the desktop renderer. Closing
the sign-in console cancels the command. Passive auto-connect never starts login.

Use an Isaac release that supports Omnigent-app login and the
`OMNIGENT_AUTH_REQUIRED` startup diagnostic before deploying this flow.
SPOG entries can include `/omnigent?o=<workspace-id>` to select the workspace;
the same full server URL is used for remote login and host startup.
Connection status and overlapping setup sign-ins are shared only for the same
full target, including `?o=`. Closing one setup window leaves a shared sign-in
running for the others; closing the last waiting window cancels it.

## MDM profile example

Use the standard `com.apple.ManagedClient.preferences` payload and the
`ai.omnigent.desktop` application preference domain. Most MDM products expose
this as a custom settings or managed preferences payload.

Replace the example organization identifiers and UUIDs before deployment.

## Local verification

For local verification, set the preference in the domain for the app you run.
Packaged release builds use `ai.omnigent.desktop`; packaged local builds and
`just electron-dev` use `ai.omnigent.desktop-dev`. The unpackaged Electron
binary retains Electron's bundle identifier, so the shell reads the dev domain
explicitly via `defaults` (packaged builds use Electron's native user defaults
API). For example, with a release build closed:

```bash
defaults write ai.omnigent.desktop serverUrls -array \
  "https://omnigent.corp.example.com/?omnigentServerName=Engineering" \
  "https://my-workspace.cloud.databricks.com/ml/omnigents"
defaults write ai.omnigent.desktop databricksInternalFeaturesEnabled -bool true
```

Remove the test values with:

```bash
defaults delete ai.omnigent.desktop serverUrls
defaults delete ai.omnigent.desktop databricksInternalFeaturesEnabled
```

For development, substitute `ai.omnigent.desktop-dev` in the commands above.
A profile for `ai.omnigent.desktop` doesn't apply to local builds, so they can
be tested on a machine that already has one. `just electron-mdm` manages the
development values:

```bash
just electron-mdm set "https://omnigent.corp.example.com/?omnigentServerName=Engineering" --internal
just electron-mdm import   # copy this Mac's managed values for the release app
just electron-mdm show
just electron-mdm clear
```

To test the onboarding flows with a local build:

| Scenario                     | Commands                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New user, no managed servers | `just electron-mdm clear`, then `just electron-run --v2-flow --reset-state`     |
| New user, managed servers    | `just electron-mdm set <url>`, then `just electron-run --v2-flow --reset-state` |
| This Mac's managed setup     | `just electron-mdm import`, then `just electron-run --v2-flow --reset-state`    |
| Returning user               | `just electron-run --v2-flow` after any of the above                            |

`--reset-state` uninstalls the CLI and removes the local build's app data, so
the next launch starts as a new user.

Production deployment should use an MDM-forced preference rather than a local
user default.
