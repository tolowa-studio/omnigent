//
// A session's runner tunnel lives on the replica keyed by its host_id, so a
// session-scoped request must carry that key on the FIRST attempt. The key comes
// from the session→host map (`getSessionHost`), which is seeded when a session
// object is parsed. But on a fresh page load, ChatPage's resource hooks fire
// their requests (`/resources/terminals`, `/resources/environments/...`,
// `/items`, ...) concurrently with — and often before — the session snapshot
// that would seed the map. Those early requests would read a null host and fall
// back to the modal host (a best-effort guess = possibly the WRONG host) → land
// on the wrong replica → 400 wrong_replica → keyless re-address. That wastes a
// round-trip and, worse, conscripts the keyless fallback (whose real job is the
// genuine wrong-replica case: an old CLI that dialed its tunnel keyless) to paper
// over "we hadn't learned the host yet."
//
// So before a session SUB-path request whose host is still unknown, bootstrap the
// map from a host-AGNOSTIC session snapshot (GET /v1/sessions/{id}, which reads
// the conversation store and returns 200 on any replica), THEN let the request
// key correctly. This generalizes the same host-first-resolve `bindStream` already
// does for the SSE stream (store/chatStore.ts). The resolver is injected (not
// imported) so identity.ts keeps no import dependency on sessionsApi.ts, which
// imports `authenticatedFetch` from here — importing back would be a cycle.
