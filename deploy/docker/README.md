# Omnigent — docker-compose stack

Run the server as a self-contained Docker stack on any host: your
laptop, a VPS, an EC2 instance, a home server, anywhere `docker
compose` runs.

The stack:
- `postgres` — persistent DB on a Docker volume
- `omnigent` — the server image (built from `../Dockerfile`)

Auth is in-process — the server has both header-proxy and native
OIDC modes built in (see [Multi-user mode](#multi-user-mode-oidc)
below). There is no separate auth-proxy container.

## Quickstart (single-user)

```bash
cd deploy/docker
./bootstrap.sh                          # mints POSTGRES_PASSWORD + cookie secret into .env
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f omnigent       # ctrl-c when boot is clean
```

`bootstrap.sh` is idempotent — re-running it leaves already-set secrets
alone. If you prefer to manage `.env` yourself, just `cp .env.example
.env` and edit `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (and `OMNIGENT_OIDC_COOKIE_SECRET`
if you're enabling OIDC) by hand.

Server is on http://localhost:8000. The web UI prints the CLI command
to launch a local runner against it. From your laptop:

```bash
omnigent run path/to/agent.yaml --server http://localhost:8000
```

Reset everything (drops the DB and the artifact store):

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Release features

Release features are deployment-wide and off by default. Enable one or more
with the comma-separated `OMNIGENT_FEATURES` variable in `.env`, then recreate
the server container:

```dotenv
OMNIGENT_FEATURES=usage_page
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/info | jq '.features'
```

Known keys and their lifecycle are documented in
[`designs/FEATURE_FLAGS.md`](../../designs/FEATURE_FLAGS.md). Unknown keys fail
server startup so a typo cannot silently produce the wrong rollout. To roll
back, remove the key (or empty the variable), run `docker compose up -d` again,
and reload the web app.

## Extra built-in agents

`OMNIGENT_BUILTIN_AGENT_DIRS` seeds extra agents that are always available
to every user. They are registered after the server's packaged native agents,
configured or locally available ACP agents, Debby, and Polly. It's a
colon-separated (`os.pathsep`) list of paths; each entry is either a
single-file agent spec (`some-agent.yaml`) or a bundle directory, and the
resulting agent's name is that path's file stem or directory name.

The path is resolved INSIDE the container, so bind-mount the host
directory that holds your spec(s) and point the env var at the mounted
path, not the host path. Neither the mount nor the env var is wired into
`docker-compose.yaml` by default — add both yourself:

```yaml
# In docker-compose.yaml, on the omnigent service:
    environment:
      OMNIGENT_BUILTIN_AGENT_DIRS: "${OMNIGENT_BUILTIN_AGENT_DIRS:-}"
    volumes:
      - artifact-data:/data
      - ./agents:/agents:ro    # host directory holding your agent spec(s)
```

```dotenv
# In .env:
OMNIGENT_BUILTIN_AGENT_DIRS=/agents/my-agent.yaml
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs omnigent | grep "built-in agent"
```

A bad or missing path is logged and skipped rather than failing startup —
the packaged built-ins still seed. Registration runs once, at startup only
(there's no live reload). After editing a spec in an existing bind mount,
restart the service so startup seeding runs again:

```bash
docker compose restart omnigent
```

After adding or changing the mount, environment variable, or other Compose
configuration, recreate the service instead:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate omnigent
```

Built-ins are keyed by name. If an extra's file stem or directory name matches
an existing built-in, startup refreshes that stable row with the extra bundle;
it does not create a second agent. Use a distinct name unless that override is
intentional.

## Multi-user mode (accounts — default)

Built-in accounts auth: no IdP to register, no proxy to host.
This is the default — `docker compose up -d` brings it up with no
extra env wiring. No credentials are auto-generated. On first boot,
when no admin exists yet and none was pre-seeded, the server creates
nothing and prints:

```
→ No admin yet. Open <base_url> to create the first admin account (choose a username + password).
```

You then open the web UI's **Create admin** form (it appears while no
admin exists) and pick your own username + password.

For any deploy reachable through a public domain, also set the
external URL so the printed link and invite links resolve correctly:

```bash
# Add to .env (bootstrap.sh already minted the cookie secret for you):
OMNIGENT_ACCOUNTS_BASE_URL=https://omnigent.example.com

docker compose up -d
docker compose logs omnigent      # shows the "No admin yet" line with your base URL
```

Once you've created the admin and signed in:

- Click your username in the top-right → **Members** → **Invite member**.
- Share the single-use URL with the teammate; they pick their own
  username and password when they redeem it.
- Sign-out lives in the same account menu.

Headless deploy (CI, Cloud Run, etc.) where you can't reach the
Create-admin form? Pre-seed the admin password so first boot creates
the admin directly:

```bash
OMNIGENT_ACCOUNTS_INIT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<your-strong-password>
```

`OMNIGENT_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_PATH` (set to `/data/admin-credentials`
in `docker-compose.yaml`) anchors the persistent state directory on
the `artifact-data` volume — it survives `docker compose restart` and
is deleted by `docker compose down -v`.

## Multi-user mode (OIDC)

Single-user mode trusts everyone who reaches the port and uses the
identity `"local"` for all requests. For a shared deploy, the server
has native OIDC support — it handles the full
login flow itself (`/auth/login`, `/auth/callback`, `/auth/logout`)
with a signed session cookie. No extra container, no Caddy basic-auth
shim, no oauth2-proxy.

### Walkthrough: GitHub OAuth (easiest to register)

1. **Register the OAuth app.** Go to
   https://github.com/settings/developers → New OAuth App. Set the
   callback to `https://<your-host>/auth/callback` (HTTPS is
   strongly recommended; GitHub permits HTTP for testing but warns).

2. **Mint a cookie secret.** `./bootstrap.sh` already did this on the
   quickstart path — `OMNIGENT_OIDC_COOKIE_SECRET` is set in your
   `.env`. If you skipped it, run `openssl rand -hex 32` and paste the
   value yourself.

3. **Edit `.env`:**
   ```bash
   OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc
   OMNIGENT_OIDC_ISSUER=https://github.com
   OMNIGENT_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.abc123…
   OMNIGENT_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=…
   OMNIGENT_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI=https://omnigent.example.com/auth/callback
   # OMNIGENT_OIDC_COOKIE_SECRET is already set by bootstrap.sh — leave it alone.
   ```

4. **Bring it up.**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   The server will fail loud at startup if any required OIDC env var
   is missing — check `docker compose logs omnigent` if it doesn't
   come up.

5. **Visit the URL** → you should be redirected to GitHub to log in,
   then back to the web UI with a `__Host-ap_session` cookie set.

### Walkthrough: Google Workspace (with domain allowlist)

```bash
OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc
OMNIGENT_OIDC_ISSUER=https://accounts.google.com
OMNIGENT_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=…apps.googleusercontent.com
OMNIGENT_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=…
OMNIGENT_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI=https://omnigent.example.com/auth/callback
OMNIGENT_OIDC_COOKIE_SECRET=<64-hex-chars>
OMNIGENT_OIDC_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=example.com,subsidiary.example.com
```

`ALLOWED_DOMAINS` is critical when the OAuth consent screen is
"External" — without it, any Google account on the planet can log in.

### Generic OIDC (Okta, Auth0, Keycloak, Entra ID)

For standard discovery, set `OMNIGENT_OIDC_ISSUER` to your provider's issuer;
the server fetches `/.well-known/openid-configuration` at startup.

```bash
OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc
OMNIGENT_OIDC_ISSUER=https://your-tenant.okta.com
OMNIGENT_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=…
OMNIGENT_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=…
OMNIGENT_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI=https://omnigent.example.com/auth/callback
OMNIGENT_OIDC_COOKIE_SECRET=<64-hex-chars>
```

#### Public PKCE clients and explicit endpoints

For an IdP application registered as a **public client**, set
`OMNIGENT_OIDC_TOKEN_ENDPOINT_AUTH_METHOD=none` and **unset**
`OMNIGENT_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`. Omnigent still sends its client ID, redirect URI,
and PKCE verifier, but omits the client-secret field entirely. This is an
explicit opt-in: the default `client_secret_post` continues to require a secret,
including for GitHub login. PKCE S256 is used in both modes.

If discovery is unavailable or advertises endpoints unsuitable for your
deployment, configure **all three** endpoint overrides:

```dotenv
OMNIGENT_OIDC_ISSUER=https://identity.example.com
OMNIGENT_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=omnigent
OMNIGENT_OIDC_TOKEN_ENDPOINT_AUTH_METHOD=none
OMNIGENT_OIDC_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT=https://login.example.com/authorize
OMNIGENT_OIDC_TOKEN_ENDPOINT=https://tokens.example.com/token
OMNIGENT_OIDC_JWKS_URI=https://keys.example.com/jwks
OMNIGENT_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI=https://omnigent.example.com/auth/callback
OMNIGENT_OIDC_COOKIE_SECRET=<64-hex-chars>
```

With all three overrides, discovery is skipped. Partial overrides fail at
startup rather than mixing endpoint sources. Leave all three unset to retain
discovery. Overrides also work with confidential clients; public-client mode
also works with discovery. Overrides do not apply to GitHub's special OAuth
login flow.

Authorization URL query parameters (for example, `?p=policy`) are preserved.
Omnigent-generated OAuth parameters take precedence on name collisions.

Only trusted operators should configure these addresses: the token endpoint
receives authorization codes and, for confidential clients, the client secret;
the JWKS endpoint determines which signing keys are trusted. Overrides must
use HTTPS without embedded credentials or fragments. HTTP is allowed only for
`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `[::1]` for local testing. Endpoint hosts may differ
from the issuer, but the token's issuer must still match
`OMNIGENT_OIDC_ISSUER` exactly, and its audience must match the client ID.

PS256-signed identity tokens are supported alongside the existing RSA and EC
algorithms. These options do not disable signature, expiration, email
verification, admission, or reauthentication checks. They configure **Omnigent
login**, not upstream MCP credentials or shared-session credential ownership.

When migrating from a custom integration that inferred public-client mode from
an absent secret, explicitly add `OMNIGENT_OIDC_TOKEN_ENDPOINT_AUTH_METHOD=none`.
If your trusted enterprise directory omits `email_verified`, the existing
`OMNIGENT_OIDC_SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=1` remains a separate operator choice;
these compatibility options never enable it automatically.

To verify a deployment, restart with the settings above, sign in from a private
browser window, then run `omnigent login <server-url>` and finish the browser
flow. Confirm both identify the expected account. The identity provider must
enforce PKCE and one-time authorization codes; Omnigent supplies the verifier.

### HTTPS for the callback URL

Most IdPs require HTTPS for non-localhost redirect URIs, and the
session cookie uses the `__Host-` prefix which browsers only
accept over HTTPS. Three options:

1. **Use the bundled Caddy overlay** (easiest — any VPS / EC2 / home
   server with a public domain):

   ```bash
   # In .env:
   OMNIGENT_DOMAIN=omnigent.example.com
   OMNIGENT_ACME_EMAIL=you@example.com      # optional, for Let's Encrypt notices

   # Point DNS A/AAAA records at the host, then:
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.https.yaml up -d
   ```

   Caddy auto-provisions and renews a Let's Encrypt cert; the
   omnigent container stops being directly exposed and only :80 +
   :443 are published. Requires Docker Compose 2.24+ for the overlay's
   `!reset` directive. See `Caddyfile` for the (3-line) config.

2. **Behind an existing reverse proxy** — point your proxy at
   `omnigent:8000` over the docker network (or `127.0.0.1:8000`
   from the host). Examples: AWS ALB with ACM cert, Cloudflare in
   "Full" SSL mode, Fly.io / Cloud Run / Render platform certs.

## Serving under a subpath (`OMNIGENT_WEB_BASE_PATH`)

By default the Web UI is served from the origin root (`/`). To serve it
under a path prefix instead — e.g. behind code-server's port proxy at
`https://<host>/proxy/6767/`, or an nginx/Traefik `location /omnigent/`
block — set the base path:

```bash
OMNIGENT_WEB_BASE_PATH=/proxy/6767 omnigent server
# or, equivalently:
omnigent server --base-path /proxy/6767
```

The Web UI then prefixes its API, SSE, WebSocket, and asset URLs with that
path, and the server accepts requests **whether or not** the proxy forwards
the prefix. That covers both code-server modes from one value:

- **`/proxy/<port>/`** strips the prefix before forwarding — the server sees
  `/v1/...` and serves it.
- **`/absproxy/<port>/`** (and plain non-rewriting proxies) forward the full
  `/proxy/6767/v1/...` — the server strips the configured prefix before
  routing.

Notes:

- Leading slash, no trailing slash (`/proxy/6767`). Empty/unset = root
  deployment (unchanged).
- The root deployment (`http://localhost:6767/`) is unaffected.
- For accounts login behind a subpath, also set `OMNIGENT_ACCOUNTS_BASE_URL`
  to the full public URL including the prefix (e.g.
  `https://<host>/proxy/6767`) so login/invite redirects and cookies resolve
  correctly. For OIDC login, set `OMNIGENT_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` to the full
  public callback URL including the prefix (e.g.
  `https://<host>/proxy/6767/auth/callback`).

## Header-proxy mode (for deploys behind an existing SSO proxy)

If you already have oauth2-proxy, Databricks Apps, AWS ALB OIDC,
Cloudflare Access, Tailscale Funnel, or any other proxy that injects
an identity header, set `OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER=header`. The
server will reject requests without the header.

```bash
OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER=header
```

The header read is `X-Forwarded-Email` by default. Proxies that use
a different header name set `OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER` to point the
server at it — for example, Cloudflare Access supplies the
authenticated email in `Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email`:

```bash
OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER=header
OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER=Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email
```

Some proxies namespace the value they inject. Google IAP forwards the
email in `X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Email` prefixed with
`accounts.google.com:`; set `OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER_STRIP_PREFIX` to drop
it and recover the bare email:

```bash
OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER=header
OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER=X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Email
OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER_STRIP_PREFIX=accounts.google.com:
```

**Security note:** in this mode the proxy is responsible for
stripping any inbound copy of the identity header from the client
request — otherwise any visitor can spoof an identity. The server
trusts whatever value reaches it.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | *required* | DB password for the bundled Postgres container. |
| `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_DB` | `omnigent` | DB user + database name. |
| `OMNIGENT_PORT` | `8000` | Host port the server is published on. |
| `OMNIGENT_AUTH_ENABLED` | `1` (in compose) | Master auth switch. `1` → accounts (or oidc if `OMNIGENT_OIDC_ISSUER` is set); `0` → single-user local mode (every request is the shared `local` user — local dev only, never shared deploys). |
| `OMNIGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER` | unset | Escape hatch to pin a mode explicitly: `header` / `accounts` / `oidc`. Overrides the `AUTH_ENABLED` auto-selection. |
| `OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER` | `X-Forwarded-Email` | Header-mode only: name of the trusted identity header. Set for proxies that use another name, e.g. `Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email` (Cloudflare Access). |
| `OMNIGENT_AUTH_HEADER_STRIP_PREFIX` | unset (strip nothing) | Header-mode only: prefix removed from the identity header value. Set to `accounts.google.com:` for Google IAP's `X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Email`. |
| `OMNIGENT_OIDC_*` | unset | OIDC config — required in oidc mode (issuer set, or `AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc`). See `.env.example`. |
| `OMNIGENT_BUILTIN_AGENT_DIRS` | unset | Colon-separated paths (in-container) to extra always-available built-in agents, seeded once at startup. See [Extra built-in agents](#extra-built-in-agents). |
| `PYPI_INDEX_URL` | `https://pypi.org/simple` | Build-time PyPI index — override only behind a corporate proxy. |

`DATABASE_URL` and `ARTIFACT_DIR` are computed by compose and
injected into the container.

## Host image (`--target host`)

The same Dockerfile publishes a second image: the official Omnigent
**host** image, which remote sandboxes boot from so they start in
seconds instead of paying an in-sandbox dependency install. It bakes
the full omnigent install (all three packages + deps, `python` and
`pip` on PATH), `git` (workspaces / worktrees), `tmux` (terminal
sessions spawned by native harnesses), and the coding-harness CLIs —
`claude`, `codex`, `pi`, and `kiro-cli`, with the runtime they need — so
claude-sdk / claude-native / codex / pi / kiro-native agents run in sandboxes
without an in-sandbox install. None of the server-only bits are
included (no SPA bundle, no psycopg, no uvicorn entrypoint).

CI publishes it next to the server image, with the same tag scheme:

- `ghcr.io/omnigent-ai/omnigent-host:latest` — tracks main HEAD
  (the default for `omnigent sandbox create --provider modal`)
- `ghcr.io/omnigent-ai/omnigent-host:sha-<short>` — immutable
  per-commit pin
- `ghcr.io/omnigent-ai/omnigent-host:vX.Y.Z` — release tags

Build it locally from the repo root:

```bash
docker build -t omnigent-host:latest --target host \
             -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile .
```

### Baking in extra harness CLIs

A harness whose CLI isn't in the image fails closed with
`harness_not_configured` when a managed-sandbox session tries to launch
it. To bake in additional harness CLIs without forking the Dockerfile,
pass `EXTRA_HARNESS_CLIS` at build time — space-separated harness names
with an optional `@version` pin, whether the CLI ships on npm or via a
vendor installer:

```bash
docker build -t omnigent-host:latest --target host \
             -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile \
             --build-arg EXTRA_HARNESS_CLIS="goose jcode opencode" .
```

Supported names (`opencode`, `qwen`, `goose`, `agy`, `jcode`, `cursor`,
`kimi`), the install method behind each, and the `npm:<pkg-spec>` escape
hatch live in [`install-harness-cli.sh`](./install-harness-cli.sh). Empty by
default — the shipped CLI set is unchanged.

Supply-chain note: the `agy` row is pinned to an immutable per-arch release
asset with a sha256 check (the same control kiro-cli gets in the default
image); the other vendor-installer rows run the harness's own `curl | bash`
off mutable refs and are verified only with a `--version` check (cursor's
installer cannot be pinned at all). `npm:<pkg-spec>` entries get no binary
smoke check — confirm the binary yourself. UBI has no baked `agy`; use
`EXTRA_HARNESS_CLIS=agy` there.

### Using it with the Modal sandbox provider

`omnigent sandbox create --provider modal` boots sandboxes from
`ghcr.io/omnigent-ai/omnigent-host:latest` by default. Your local
checkout's wheels are still built and overlaid on top at create time
(`pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps`), so the sandbox runs
exactly your code — the baked image just supplies the dependency
tree. A checkout that adds a brand-new dependency needs that package
installed manually in the sandbox until the official image rebuilds
with it.

Two environment variables tune the pull:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `OMNIGENT_MODAL_HOST_IMAGE` | Override the image ref, e.g. an org-internal copy (`ghcr.io/<your-org>/omnigent-host:latest`) or a `:sha-<short>` pin. |
| `OMNIGENT_MODAL_REGISTRY_SECRET` | Name of a [Modal secret](https://modal.com/secrets) holding registry credentials for private pulls. Create it with keys `REGISTRY_USERNAME` (your registry username) and `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` (for GHCR: a personal access token with `read:packages`). Unset = anonymous pull. |

### Using it with the Daytona sandbox provider

The same host image backs Daytona-managed sessions (server config
`sandbox.provider: daytona`; Daytona is managed-only — there is no
`omnigent sandbox create --provider daytona` CLI flow). Daytona ingests
the registry image into an internal snapshot on first use (the first
launch from a given image takes minutes; later launches reuse the
snapshot and take seconds). Override the ref with
`OMNIGENT_DAYTONA_HOST_IMAGE` or the server config's
`sandbox.daytona.image`. See
[`deploy/daytona/README.md`](../daytona/README.md) for the
full provider guide (credentials, the free-tier egress relay, and
security considerations).
