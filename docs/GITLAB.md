# GitLab merge requests

The session pull request panel shows GitLab merge requests using `glab` on the
execution host. Sign in there before opening the panel:

```sh
glab auth login --hostname gitlab.com
glab auth status --hostname gitlab.com
```

Omnigent uses the CLI's existing credentials. It does not require a GitLab OAuth
connection in Omnigent. Install and authenticate `glab` inside a sandbox when
that sandbox runs the session.

## Private instances and remotes

Sign in to each private GitLab instance with `glab` on the execution host:

```sh
glab auth login --hostname git.example.com
```

Omnigent discovers hosts from the CLI's config file. No Omnigent host
setting or OAuth connection is needed. It follows `GLAB_CONFIG_DIR`, the legacy
`~/.config/glab-cli` directory, and glab's platform-specific XDG config search
order. Host changes take effect without restarting the runner. After logout,
the host stays recognizable so existing MRs can still be selected or removed;
API reads show the sign-in hint until credentials are restored.
GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps remotes can coexist in one checkout.

For a web origin with a nondefault HTTPS port, include that port when signing in:

```sh
GITLAB_HOST=git.example.com:8443 glab auth login --api-host git.example.com:8443
```

The host selection above applies only to the login command. `glab` saves the
authority including its port; Omnigent reads it on subsequent requests. A
separate `api_host` remains glab's API routing setting, not an additional web
origin. GitLab.com is supported by default. Nested groups and project-local MR
numbers are preserved:

```text
https://git.example.com:8443/company/team/project.git
git@git.example.com:company/team/project.git
https://git.example.com:8443/company/team/project/-/merge_requests/42
```

An SSH remote maps to the discovered HTTPS authority for its hostname. Its SSH
port does not become the API port. When two allowed authorities share a hostname,
use an HTTPS remote to select the intended one.

Existing `OMNIGENT_GIT_PROVIDER_GITLAB_HOSTS`, `GITLAB_HOST`, and `GLAB_HOST`
overrides remain supported when explicit instance configuration is useful.

## Panel and tracking

Open the Pull Requests tab in the session's Workspace sidepanel, or click the
MR number beside its composer. The current branch's merge request is inferred from its upstream
remote, then `origin`, then other GitLab remotes and the fork's parent project.
The source project comes from `branch.<name>.pushRemote`, then `remote.pushDefault`,
then the branch's tracking remote, `origin`, or another GitLab remote. An explicit
`git push <remote>` does not change that configuration. Discovery requires both
the source project ID and the current branch to match. Paste an MR URL into the panel
to attach another accessible merge request. Removing it prevents automatic
tracking from adding it again; attaching it manually restores it.

The panel shows the title, description, state, draft status, comments, pipeline
jobs and downstream jobs, changed files, and diff. Expanded text-file context
reads the target project at the MR's merge-base and the source project at its
head revision, including fork merge requests. Refresh after the MR changes
before expanding context again.

Successful `glab mr` mutations and `glab api` MR writes are tracked from their
explicit target or result. Supported GitLab MCP mutation tools are tracked too.
GitLab push options such as `git push -o merge_request.create` or
`-o merge_request.title=...` track the MR reported in GitLab's successful push
output, including banners delivered separately on stderr. Dry runs, failed
pushes, and ordinary pushes do not create associations.
These agent operations work from another repository or worktree; branch discovery
only covers the session workspace. Native agents retain the host's `GLAB_CONFIG_DIR`
(and GitHub's `GH_CONFIG_DIR`) so their CLI tools use the same login.
Read commands, comments, failed commands, and URLs quoted inside descriptions
do not create associations. For MCP fork creation, supply `target_project_id`
when the tool supports it; ambiguous source-project paths may require linking
the resulting MR manually. Silent CLI commands should use a full MR or repository
URL, or an inline `GITLAB_HOST` assignment. Tracking does not guess configured
CLI or MCP hosts: without an explicit host, it needs the returned MR identity
or manual linking. Tracking does not make API calls.

## Limits and verification

Each panel request has an eight-second CLI budget. Lists are limited to 500
items. The panel marks incomplete comments, checks, and file lists. Files without
a text patch (including empty, binary, metadata-only, or omitted large files)
show a per-file notice while readable diffs remain visible. Truncated file lists
still direct you to GitLab for the full diff. A failed content read is an error
rather than an apparent file deletion.

Account selection remains in `glab`; the panel has no GitLab account or base
remote switcher. Repository picking, webhook events, and managed sandbox
credential provisioning are separate features.

To verify manually:

1. Sign in with `glab auth login`, then start a session in a GitLab checkout with
   an open MR without setting Omnigent provider hosts. Open
   its Pull Requests tab. Confirm the `!` number, description, comments, and pipeline
   results match GitLab.
2. Open a changed file, then expand context. For a fork MR, check a renamed file
   against the target merge-base and source head in GitLab.
3. Attach a second MR URL, select it, remove it, and refresh. Confirm it remains
   removed, then attach it again. Remove the final association too: no removed
   MR link or load error should remain, including after refresh.
4. Repeat through the compact composer control and at mobile width. Without
   `glab` authentication, confirm the panel keeps the checkout context and shows
   an actionable sign-in or access hint.
5. In a real native agent session, create MRs in another worktree using both
   `glab mr create` and `git push -o merge_request.create`. Confirm they appear
   automatically as created associations, survive refresh, and stay removed
   after unlinking. A manual hook invocation does not cover native launch.
