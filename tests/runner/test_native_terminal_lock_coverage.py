"""Regression guards: every built-in native harness must be wired into the
runner's terminal dispatch, and devin into the interrupt/stop maps.

A native harness absent from the terminal lock dispatch raised ``KeyError`` mid
terminal-ensure (surfaced as "malformed runner response (HTTP 500)") — the class
of bug that broke devin-native's "start a chat". Absence from the interrupt/stop
maps instead made the web Stop button a silent no-op. These pin both so a future
built-in native harness that is not fully wired fails a test rather than a user.

The lock-coverage guard is scoped to the BUILT-IN native providers, not the
merged registry: a community-contributed native harness wires its own launcher
and must not be forced into the built-in dispatch.
