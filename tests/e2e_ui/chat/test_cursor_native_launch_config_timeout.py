"""E2E: a transient slow session-snapshot read must not brick a cursor-native launch.

Regression test for the cursor-native terminal auto-create failure signature
``Failed to auto-create cursor terminal for <session>`` (runner logger
``omnigent.runner.app`` / ``_launch_native_terminal``): on bind, the
runner's cursor launch path
reads the session snapshot exactly once --
``_pi_native_launch_config`` in ``omnigent/runner/native/orchestration.py``
issues a single ``GET /v1/sessions/{id}`` with a hard 10s read budget and no
retry -- so one slow response (a genuine ``httpx.ReadTimeout``: a saturated
uplink, a briefly stalled server, a laptop waking from sleep) permanently
fails the whole terminal auto-create. The runner catches the resulting
``RuntimeError: Could not fetch Pi launch config for '<id>'.``, logs
``Failed to auto-create cursor terminal for <id>`` and publishes
``session.status: failed`` ("Native Cursor terminal failed to start; see the
runner log ...") with no terminal and no retry, even though the degradation
cleared seconds later. The user sees the session go failed (the SPA error
pill) instead of the cursor-agent TUI.

The journey this drives is the reported one: start a Cursor wrapper session
(the exact terminal-first spec ``omnigent cursor`` ships), open it in the web
app, and let the runner bind + auto-create the terminal while the runner's
network path to the server is briefly degraded. The degradation is injected
by a loopback TCP proxy interposed between the runner and the server that
forwards the two bind/init snapshot reads untouched and then holds ONLY the
launch-config GET for this session past the fetch's 10s read budget --
disarming itself the instant it captures that one request, so exactly one
fetch is degraded (a single transient timeout, matching the field signature:
a handful of events, no broad outage).

While the bug is live the launch dies on that one slow read and this test
FAILS with the launch-config error (session ``failed``, no terminal); once the
fetch tolerates a transient slow read (a retry, a saner budget), the terminal
comes up and the test passes. The proxy has already disarmed by the time a fix
retries, so the retry's second GET flows instantly -- the fixed path recovers
and the test transitions fail -> pass.

The rig mirrors ``test_native_pinned_model_namespace_launch.py``: a dedicated
server + runner pair with isolated ``HOME`` / ``OMNIGENT_CONFIG_HOME`` so no
ambient provider config or credential leaks in, plus the interposed proxy. No
LLM traffic is needed -- the failure under test happens before the TUI would
render anything, and on the fixed path the terminal resource registers as
soon as the pane launches, even without a usable cursor login.
