"""E2E: the "Hide unconfigured harnesses" setting filters the New Chat picker.

The landing composer (``NewChatLandingScreen`` in
``web/src/shell/NewChatDialog.tsx``) lists every harness and badges the ones
that aren't set up on the selected host. The Settings → Appearance toggle
``HideUnconfiguredHarnessesControl`` (``pages/SettingsPage.tsx``) writes
``localStorage["omnigent:hide-unconfigured-harnesses"]``; when on, the picker's
**Harnesses** group drops rows the selected host reports as unconfigured
(``harnessUnconfiguredOnHost`` against the host's ``configured_harnesses`` map).

This drives the whole flow end to end against the rendered UI: the toggle
starts off (every harness shown), flipping the real Switch persists the
preference, and the picker then hides the harness the stubbed host reports as
unconfigured while keeping the configured one.

Why the ``page.route`` stubbing and the async-in-a-fresh-thread shape: both are
inherited from ``chat/test_codex_auth_availability.py`` — the e2e harness's
runner tunnels into the server and registers no *host*, so faking ``/v1/hosts``
(with ``configured_harnesses``) and ``/v1/agents`` is the established way to
drive the landing picker, and once a pytest-playwright *sync* test has run in
the session, pytest-asyncio can't start a loop on the main thread, so each
async body runs in its own thread via :func:`asyncio.run`.
