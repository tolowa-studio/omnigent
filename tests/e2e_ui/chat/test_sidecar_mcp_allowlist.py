"""E2E: a sidecar ``tools/mcp/*.yaml`` per-server ``tools:`` allow-list
must actually restrict the agent's tool surface.

A per-server ``tools:`` allow-list is honoured when an MCP server is
declared **inline** under ``tools:`` in ``config.yaml``, but was
**silently ignored** when the same server is declared in a **sidecar**
``tools/mcp/*.yaml`` file. The inline parser reads and validates the
key; both sidecar parsers (``_parse_stdio_mcp_server`` /
``_parse_http_mcp_server`` in ``omnigent/spec/parser.py``) build the
``MCPServerConfig`` without ``tools=``, so the allow-list disappears
before it reaches the enforcement seam. The failure is *open*: the
agent gets MORE tools than the spec asked for, with no warning.

Journey (all user-observable):

1. A spec author writes an agent whose only tool is an MCP server
   declared in the SIDECAR form (``tools/mcp/probe.yaml``), with a
   restrictive ``tools:`` allow-list that excludes a destructive tool
   (here ``danger``, standing in for the real ``sandbox_clear``).
2. Deploy the agent and start a session on it.
3. Drive a turn in which the model attempts the *excluded* ``danger``
   tool.
4. On the broken build the excluded tool is advertised to the model and
   executes anyway (the chat shows ``danger-executed: ...``); the
   allow-list was silently dropped. When the allow-list is honoured the
   excluded tool is absent from the advertised surface and never runs.

The mock LLM scripts the turn (call ``danger``, then a wrap-up
sentence), so the only thing under test is which tools the sidecar
allow-list exposes.

Robustness: the guard reads the tool surface the harness advertises to
the model (captured on the FIRST LLM request, before any tool dispatch),
so it settles cleanly on both the broken and the fixed build regardless
of how a filtered tool call is handled downstream.
