# Resilience lab

A disposable Omnigent topology for testing what users see when the network
misbehaves. It runs a real server, the real `omnigent host` daemon (or a bare
runner), the real Claude Code or Codex TUI and the shared mock model. Every network link
goes through a fault proxy that a test or a person can break on demand.

```text
browser / API user ──► proxies.client ──┐
host daemon ──┐                          ├──► server
runner ───────┼──────► proxies.host ─────┘
harness hooks ┘
Claude Code ─────────► proxies.model ──────► mock model
```

`proxies.host` tags each connection by its first request line: `host.tunnel`,
`runner.tunnel` or `host.http`. `proxies.client` uses `client.sse`, `client.ws`
or `client.http`. A fault can target one tag, for example only the runner
tunnel, while everything else keeps flowing. Lab probes (`lab.observer`,
`lab.snapshot`, `lab.items`) bypass the proxies, so a fault never hides the
state being asserted.

## Run it

Requires `claude`, `codex` and `tmux` on `PATH`. Tests skip without them.

```sh
uv run --no-sync pytest tests/e2e/resilience -v
OMNIGENT_E2E_RESILIENCE_FULL=1 uv run --no-sync pytest tests/e2e/resilience/scenarios -n 2  # 60 s/120 s outages
```

To poke at the UI by hand, start a lab with a fault console:

```sh
uv run --no-sync python -m tests.e2e.resilience.lab            # --mode runner, --front direct
```

The console prints a session URL behind `proxies.client`. Open it, chat, and
type commands such as `restart-server 20`, `blackhole host 30 runner.tunnel`,
`sleep-host 60`, `hold` / `release` or `conns host`. `help` lists them all.

## Scenarios

Scenario scripts live in `scenarios/`. Each one implements a row family of
the matrix in [`docs/network-resilience.md`](../../../docs/network-resilience.md).
They are built from four pieces:

- `SessionDriver` (`lab/driver.py`) sends user turns through the client link.
  It scripts Claude's replies by a unique marker and leaves marker-named files
  in the workspace, so a scenario can tell which tool side effects ran.
  `start_tool_turn`, `start_approval_turn` and `round_trip` put a session into
  a known phase.
- `SessionWatcher` (`lab/observe.py`) records every published `session.status`
  edge and polls the snapshot directly on the server, building a timeline of
  what the user saw.
- `ScenarioReport` (`lab/report.py`) records each contract expectation as a
  check. It writes JSON and Markdown to `.omnigent/resilience/`, then fails
  with every broken check and the timeline. `python -m tests.e2e.resilience.lab.report`
  prints the saved runs as one matrix.
- `lab_factory` (`conftest.py`) starts labs. It keeps the root of a failing
  run, or of every run with `OMNIGENT_RESILIENCE_KEEP=1`.

`scenarios/_contract.py` holds the shared phases (idle, tool running, tool
ending during the outage, approval pending) and the checks every scenario
records once its fault clears.

Rows that break the contract today are pinned to their finding in one of two
ways. A row that breaks several checks is marked `xfail(strict=True)`. When a
single check fails, it gets `report.check(..., known_gap="R5")` instead, so
the row's other checks still guard against regressions. Either way, a fix that
makes the row pass must also remove the marker.

S6 drives a real page with Playwright's Chromium against the built web UI
(`pnpm --filter web run build`). It is skipped when either is missing.

## Recording what the user sees

Set `OMNIGENT_RESILIENCE_VIDEO=1` (chat view) or `=both` (chat and terminal
views) to record every scenario. The video is taken from the user's side: a
headless Chromium opens the session through `proxies.client`, as a real
browser would. A client-link fault therefore cuts the recorder's own
connection too.

- Every fault, recovery and user action in the event log appears as a
  timestamped caption at the top of the page. Red marks a fault, green a
  recovery, and blue the user (for example "user: clicks Approve").
- A corner badge names the scenario and its parameters and shows a running
  clock.
- The run ends on a verdict panel listing each broken check or known gap.

Videos are written to `.omnigent/resilience/videos/` and linked from each
report. `python -m tests.e2e.resilience.lab.report --html` writes
`.omnigent/resilience/index.html`, with every run's checks next to its
videos. Recording needs the built web UI (`pnpm --filter web run build`) and
Playwright's Chromium. Without them it is skipped with a warning, and the
scenario still runs.

```sh
OMNIGENT_RESILIENCE_VIDEO=both OMNIGENT_E2E_RESILIENCE_FULL=1 \
  uv run --no-sync pytest "tests/e2e/resilience/scenarios/test_s2_server_restart.py::test_s2_server_restart[claude-approval_pending-60s]"
uv run --no-sync python -m tests.e2e.resilience.lab.report --html
```

The terminal view shows the harness's own TUI. On a machine with Claude Code
managed settings, it also shows that machine's managed hooks failing in the
lab's isolated home. That noise is local, and CI does not have it.

## Faults

| Call | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `proxy.blackhole(tags)` | Hold bytes and closes both ways while sockets stay open (half-open); held bytes flush on clear. |
| `proxy.refuse(tags)` | Refuse new connections. With no tags the listener closes, so the port is refused. |
| `proxy.delay(s, tags)` / `proxy.throttle(bps, tags)` | Add latency or cap bandwidth. |
| `proxy.reset(tags)` / `proxy.close(tags)` | RST or FIN live connections now. |
| `proxy.recycle(lifetime_s, tags)` | Close connections older than a lifetime, like an ingress recycling streams. |
| `proxy.sever_held(after_s, tags)` | Answer `504` to a request still waiting for a response after `after_s`, like a front-door request cap. |
| `proxy.flap(up_s=, down_s=, mode=)` | Alternate outages with healthy periods. |
| `lab.restart_server(downtime_s=, graceful=)` / `with lab.server_down()` | Deploy (SIGTERM) or crash (SIGKILL) the server. |
| `with lab.sleep_host()` | Freeze every host-side process (daemon, runners, tmux, Claude) and blackhole their links. |
| `lab.kill_runner()` | SIGKILL the runner processes. |

Faults return a handle. Use it as a context manager or call `.clear()`. Every
connection, fault and process action is appended to `<lab root>/events.jsonl`.

`LabConfig(front="ingress")`, the default, makes a stopped server answer `502`
like the Databricks Apps front door. `front="direct"` refuses connections, as
a bare local server does.

## Isolation

The lab removes ambient `OMNIGENT_*`, `DATABRICKS_*`, `ANTHROPIC_*` and proxy
settings. It points `DATABRICKS_CONFIG_FILE` at an empty file and keeps
config, data and the Claude config directory under a short `/tmp/rlab-*` root.
tmux socket paths must stay under the macOS limit.

Claude Code managed settings can pin `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to a corporate
gateway, and environment variables cannot override that. Host-side processes
therefore get `HTTPS_PROXY` pointed at `proxies.model` and trust a throwaway
CA through `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. The proxy terminates those tunnels and serves
only model API paths (`/v1/messages` and similar) from the mock. Everything
else, including telemetry, auth and update checks, gets `403`, and nothing
intercepted leaves the machine.

Claude Code also sends title and summary requests that quote the user's
message. Script a turn with `lab.script_turn(marker, replies)`. It claims the
queue by a marker in the message and requires the `Bash` tool, so those side
requests cannot consume it.

A passing test deletes its lab root. A failing test keeps it and prints its
path, logs and URLs.

## Limits

- `sleep_host` uses SIGSTOP, which keeps wall and monotonic clocks in step, so
  the runner's suspend detection does not fire. It exercises the keepalive and
  half-open path, the same path a network change without sleep takes.
- A blackholed new connection is accepted instead of hanging in SYN-SENT.
  Clients see a read timeout rather than a connect timeout.
- claude-native and codex-native are wired. Other harnesses need their own
  model routing and turn scripting in `lab/driver.py`.
- Codex's `exec_command` yields after at most 30 s, so a long Codex tool phase
  is a chain of shorter calls. Each call is a model round trip and a policy
  hook, which matters during server outages.
