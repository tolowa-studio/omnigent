"""S7: Claude Code loses its model provider while the rest of Omnigent is fine.

Only the model link breaks: new connections are refused and live ones reset,
either before the turn's first model call or in the middle of a streamed
reply. Contract: a short loss is retried and the turn completes once. A long
one ends in a failure the user can retry with one action. The session never
spins in ``running`` with nothing happening.
