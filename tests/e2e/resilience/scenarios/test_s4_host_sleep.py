"""S4: the host sleeps (laptop lid closed) and wakes while Claude has work in flight.

Every host-side process freezes and the host's links go dark. On wake the
processes resume first and the network follows. Contract: as for any outage
within the grace, nothing visibly fails; past it the session recovers once
the host is back.
