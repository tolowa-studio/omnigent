"""S5: the host is offline while the user, elsewhere, keeps using the session.

The host's links are down (refused, as when the laptop has no network) and the
server and browser are fine. The user sends a message, answers a pending
approval, or stops a running turn. Contract: each action is either applied
exactly once when the host returns, or refused at once so the user knows to
retry. It is never silently dropped or applied twice.
