"""S1: the ingress recycles long-lived connections and caps held requests.

Databricks Apps closes long-lived streams every few minutes and answers 504 to
a request held past its cap. The lab compresses both. Browser connections are
recycled every 8 s, and host and runner connections once they outlive the
reconnect grace. A request left waiting ``_SEVER_S`` for a response gets a
504. Contract: none of this is visible. A pending approval card stays on
screen, a running tool finishes once, and no failure is shown.
