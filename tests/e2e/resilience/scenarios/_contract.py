"""Phases and UX-contract checks shared by every scenario script.

A scenario puts a session into a phase, applies its fault, then calls
:func:`finish` to record the checks from ``docs/network-resilience.md``:
interrupted work completes exactly once, a pending approval survives, the
next turn works, the status settles, and no failure shows within the grace.
