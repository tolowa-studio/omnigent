"""E2E regression test: a deleted session agent surfaces a distinct,
client-safe error — not a generic native-terminal startup failure.

Guards the fault-attribution fix for "native Claude terminal startup and
ensure failures". When a claude-native session's bound agent is no longer
present in the agent store, ensuring the Claude terminal (or dispatching a
turn that ensures it) resolves the missing spec and fails. Previously that one
session-lifecycle condition was surfaced at three layers as a generic
``native_terminal_start_failed`` / ``Native Claude terminal failed to start``
startup defect, so it was counted against the terminal-startup error signal:

* the runner's ``_ensure_native_terminal`` -> ``_claude_ensure_build`` ->
  ``_resolve_session_spec_entry`` cannot resolve the agent (the server's
  ``GET /agent/contents`` 404s) and raises ``session spec resolver: agent
  '<hex>' for session '<id>' was not found``;
* the runner returned that as a generic native-terminal-start failure, which
  the server's ``create_session_terminal`` route re-raised verbatim; and
* inside a turn, ``_publish_status`` logged ``session turn failed for <id>:
  Native Claude terminal failed to start; ...``.

The agent-not-found cause is a genuine session-lifecycle event (the agent was
deleted or rebound out from under a live session), not a tmux/FileNotFound
infra fault or an "exited before available" teardown. The fix classifies it
with its own ``ErrorCode.SESSION_AGENT_MISSING`` (410 Gone, USER category):
the runner raises that code, and the native-terminal error builder detects it
and surfaces a distinct, client-safe message pointing the user at recreating
the agent / starting a new session — while the runner log still carries the
spec-resolver cause for operators. This test asserts that corrected
attribution end to end: the surfaced code/message reflect the lifecycle
condition, and the cleared ``Claude terminal ensure failed for session=``
startup-defect log line no longer fires.

This drives the REAL user journey end to end against a real ``omnigent
server`` subprocess and a real runner subprocess:

1. Create a claude-native-eligible session bound to a real (session-scoped)
   agent — the state a launched session is in.
2. Establish the reported precondition faithfully via the real store API:
   the agent the session is bound to is no longer present in the agent store
   (deleted/rotated/GC'd while the session persists).
3. Bind the session to the runner.
4. Trigger the exact request the ``omnigent claude`` wrapper / native
   bootstrap sends — ``POST /v1/sessions/<id>/resources/terminals`` with
   ``{"terminal": "claude", "session_key": "main", "ensure_native_terminal":
   true}`` — so the runner's genuine ensure path runs.

The genuine ensure path (``_ensure_native_terminal`` ->
``_claude_ensure_build`` -> ``_resolve_session_spec_entry`` -> the server's
``GET /agent/contents`` returning 404 because the agent is gone) then produces
the reported 500 body and the reported runner-log signature. Nothing about the
error body or the failure state is hand-fabricated: the store delete is the
precondition, and the running server+runner produce the failure themselves.

The Claude CLI is replaced with a tiny stub on PATH purely as defense — the
failure happens at spec resolution, before any ``claude`` process is launched.

    Journey: a claude-native-eligible session exists bound to an agent; the
