"""``web_read`` backend: Nimble Web API single-URL retrieval.

Fetches one arbitrary URL as clean content via Nimble's Web API
(``POST /v2/extract``), which drives a real browser to render JavaScript — so
client-rendered pages return usable content where a plain HTTP fetch returns an
empty skeleton or an error response.

Distinct from the ``nimble_extract`` builtin (which runs a pre-defined extract
*template* against known sites) and ``web_search`` (which returns result links):
this is "give me any URL, get the page back."

Configured in the agent spec::

    tools:
      builtins:
        - name: web_read
          read_provider: nimble
          api_key: ${NIMBLE_API_KEY}
          # optional:
          # driver: vx8            # auto | vx8 default | vx10 / vx12 (+ -pro) | vx6 (plain HTTP)
          # output_format: markdown  # markdown (default) | html
