        unexpected terminal exit so resource/session lifecycle stays
        aligned with the underlying tmux process. No-op when no publisher
        is installed (e.g. embedded/test runners).

        :data:`CLAUDE_NATIVE_TERMINAL_ROLE` or

        session's working status: pane activity → ``running`` and a short
        quiescence → ``idle``, emitted via the session-status publisher.
        This PTY-derived status catches cases lifecycle hooks can miss
        because it observes the terminal directly. The status edges are
