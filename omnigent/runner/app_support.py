    Log *exc* in full and return a generic detail string safe for clients.

    Raw exception text (``str(exc)``) can embed absolute paths, internal
    hostnames, PIDs, and other server-side state. The runner is reached via
    the AP server proxy and its error bodies are relayed to the caller, so
    the cause is logged here for operators while the HTTP response carries
    only this fixed string. The structured ``error`` code that accompanies
    the detail already names the failure category for the caller.

    The runner's own log path is named so the reader can go read the cause
    instead of hunting for it; it is home-relative (``~/…``) so it points
    somewhere without leaking the account name.
