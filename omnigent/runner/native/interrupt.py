"""Native-harness interrupt / stop control for the runner app.

The runner receives ``interrupt`` and ``stop_session`` events on
``/v1/sessions/{id}/events`` and must forward them into the resident vendor
TUI/bridge for the session's native harness. The per-harness logic used to be
sixteen closures inside :mod:`omnigent.runner.app`; this module collapses them
onto one :class:`NativeInterruptRunner` so the dispatch is registry-driven.

Mirrors :class:`omnigent.runner.codex.goal.CodexGoalRunner`: app-scope state
(the AP client, resource registry, event publisher, sub-agent wake plumbing) is
injected at construction so the class stays out of the already-large app module
while preserving the exact behavior of the original closures.

The seven uniform interrupt harnesses and six uniform stop harnesses differ
only by bridge module, control-function name, and error label; they collapse to
two parametrized methods driven by :data:`_UNIFORM_INTERRUPT` /
:data:`_UNIFORM_STOP`. claude interrupt (bridge-id resolution) and codex
interrupt (MCP-startup + app-server ``turn/interrupt``) keep dedicated methods
(so nine interrupt handlers total); claude stop is likewise special-cased and
codex/pi alias stop to their interrupt handler (so seven stop handlers total).

Coverage note: antigravity-native and opencode-native have no handler here and
:meth:`interrupt` / :meth:`stop` return ``None`` for them, so the caller falls
through to the in-process turn cancel — unchanged from before this seam. Wiring
their native interrupt (agy ``interrupt_turn`` / opencode ``client.abort``) is a
deferred follow-up.
