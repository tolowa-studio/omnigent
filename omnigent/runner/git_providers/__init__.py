"""Pull request facet protocol: the provider-specific half of the session PR panel.

``omnigent.runner.pr_resource`` keeps the provider-neutral steps: the selected
PR, tracked PRs and their cached titles, branch inference, attach and remove,
and routing preferences. It calls a :class:`PullRequestFacet` for each step
that talks to a forge. ``omnigent.runner.pr_observer`` calls the observer
methods to find PRs in completed tool calls. A provider's ``pull_requests``
facet module (see :func:`omnigent.git_providers.load_facet`) exposes one
instance::

    PULL_REQUESTS: PullRequestFacet = ForgePullRequests()

The observer loads every provider's facet when a tool call completes, so a
facet module imports its panel-only dependencies inside the methods that use them.

Payload contract:

- The info payload's ``object`` is ``"session.github.info"`` for every
  provider. It is a stable wire id, not a provider name.
- Every provider fills the neutral info fields: ``available`` (with ``reason``
  when false), ``branch``, ``base_ref``, ``repo`` (``{"name_with_owner": ...}``),
  ``pr``, and ``selected_pr_url`` for a tracked PR.
- ``pr`` has ``number``, ``url`` (a URL that its provider's descriptor
  parses), ``title``, ``state`` (``"OPEN"``, ``"MERGED"``, or ``"CLOSED"``),
  ``is_draft``, ``author``, ``base_ref``, ``head_ref``, ``head_sha``,
  ``base_sha``, ``checks`` (``passing``, ``failing``, ``pending``, ``total``,
  and ``runs`` of ``{name, bucket, url}``), ``body``, and ``comments`` of
  ``{author, body, created_at, url}``.
- Changed files are a ``list`` of ``session.github.changed_file`` objects:
  ``path``, ``name``, ``status`` (``created``, ``modified``, ``deleted``, or
  ``renamed``), ``lines_added``, and ``lines_removed``. The PR diff is a
  ``session.github.pr_diff`` with ``patch``. One file's diff is a
  ``session.github.file_diff`` with ``path``, ``before``, and ``after``.

Additive fields:

- ``provider``: the provider id, e.g. ``"github"``; null for an unsupported remote.
- ``auth``: a :class:`PullRequestAuth`; null when ``available`` is false.
- ``capabilities``: :meth:`ProviderCapabilities.to_json`; null for an unsupported remote.
- ``remote_host``: only with ``reason: "unsupported_remote"``.
- PR associations in ``prs`` carry ``provider``.
- The dispatcher adds descriptor ``provider_display`` to info and associations.
- ``pr`` may carry ``author_id``, the PR author's stable id on the provider; optional,
  may be null.
- A comment may carry ``author_id``, the author's stable id on the provider; optional,
  may be null.
- A changed file's ``lines_added`` and ``lines_removed`` may be null.
- Report lookup failures in ``warnings``. Mark incomplete checks/comments with
  ``checks.partial`` / ``comments_partial``; changed files use ``has_more`` or ``warning``.
- An unavailable PR diff has an empty ``patch`` and ``unavailable_reason``, with
  an optional user-facing ``message``. ``pr_outside_workspace`` names that specific case.

GitHub also keeps the legacy top-level ``gh_available``, ``authenticated``,
``accounts``, and ``selected_account``, which ``auth`` supersedes. They are
deprecated and will be removed in 0.19.0. Other providers omit them.
