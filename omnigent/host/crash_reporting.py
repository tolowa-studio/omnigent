"""Crash and exit reporting for the host daemon process.

The host daemon runs detached with stdout/stderr redirected to its log file, so
an uncaught traceback or a signal death otherwise never reaches ``logging`` --
and therefore never reaches the debug-log sink. This module routes every exit
of a running host (``run_host_process``) through one structured
``host_exiting`` event and logs crashes that do not end the process (background
threads, asyncio tasks). A daemon launch that loses the registry claim exits
before becoming a host and reports no exit event.
