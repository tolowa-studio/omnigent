"""In-memory registry of live host WebSocket connections.

Each server replica maintains one :class:`HostRegistry` tracking
hosts with active WebSocket tunnels on this replica. The persistent
``hosts`` DB table (queried by ``HostStore``) is the cross-replica
source of truth for which hosts exist; this registry only tracks
which hosts are live *here*.

Simpler than :class:`TunnelRegistry` because the host tunnel
carries only control frames (launch/stop runner), not HTTP
request/response traffic. No per-request reassembly queues needed.

The registry also holds what connected hosts *report* about themselves and
nothing persists — today the per-family gateway-inference map (see
:mod:`omnigent.gateway_inference`) and interactive-shell inventory. They are
delivered on the connect handshake, so a replica that has never seen a host
simply knows nothing about them until the host reconnects and re-reports.
