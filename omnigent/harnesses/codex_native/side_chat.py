"""Codex ``/side`` ephemeral side-chat support for the native Codex harness.

A side chat is an ephemeral fork of the active Codex thread. It inherits the
parent's history as *reference only*, never persists to disk (``ephemeral``),
and is driven out-of-band over the app-server via ``turn/start`` on the child
thread id. Because the fork is a separate thread, the driven Codex TUI keeps
showing the main conversation the whole time: the side chat surfaces only as an
Omnigent sub-agent (rail) child, never in the left sidebar.

Why a fork and not the claude-native ``/btw`` overlay: Codex ``/side`` is a
multi-turn ephemeral fork (Codex's own ``/side`` == ``/btw`` == "start a side
conversation in an ephemeral fork"), so modelling it as a persistent, navigable
sub-agent chat fits its behaviour.

Process split (native Codex runs across processes; each helper lives where its
inputs do):

* The **executor** (which injects turns via a bridge-state app-server client)
  detects ``/side`` and opens the fork: :func:`side_chat_question` +
  :func:`open_side_chat_on_client`.
* The **forwarder** (which watches the app-server event stream and holds the
  ``_CodexForwarderState`` + Omnigent HTTP client) auto-surfaces the fork as a
  rail child: :func:`register_side_fork_child`, keyed off the fork's
  ``forkedFromId`` (:func:`is_omnigent_side_fork`).

Storage / cache notes (verified against the Codex source + the installed 0.147.0
app-server schema): ``ephemeral=true`` means no rollout / no state-db row (parity
with native ``/side``, not resumable after a runner restart), and an ephemeral
root fork reuses the parent's session id for cache routing inside Codex, so we
deliberately do NOT pin a ``prompt_cache_key``.
