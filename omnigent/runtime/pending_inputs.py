"""In-process index of un-consumed web-composer user messages.

Backs the optimistic "queued message" bubble for native-terminal
sessions (claude-native / codex-native) so it survives a client
re-bind. On those sessions the Omnigent server does NOT persist a web-typed
user message at POST time — the message is forwarded into the vendor
TUI and the transcript forwarder later mirrors it back as the single
durable writer (see ``_dispatch_session_event_to_runner``). Until that
round-trip completes the message lives nowhere on the server, so a
client that navigates away and back (or whose SSE pump rebinds
mid-flight via ``ensureBoundSession``) loses the optimistic bubble it
rendered locally — it reappears only once the transcript persists it.

This index closes that window with the same shape the codebase already
uses for transient recovery state (:mod:`pending_elicitations`,
:mod:`inflight_text`):

* populated by the route layer on a native web message POST (via
  :func:`record`, before the runner forward), so the message is known
  server-side immediately;
* replayed into the cold-load snapshot (``GET /v1/sessions/{id}``) via
  :func:`snapshot_for`, so a (re)connecting client re-hydrates the
  bubble instead of showing nothing;
* drained when the transcript forwarder persists the matching user
  message (via :func:`resolve_matching_text`, falling back to
  :func:`resolve_oldest`), so the now-committed item doesn't
  double-render alongside a stale pending entry.

Unlike :mod:`pending_elicitations` / :mod:`inflight_text`, this index
is NOT populated through the :func:`session_stream.publish` chokepoint:
recording needs to return the new entry id to the POST handler (so the
sender can adopt it and dedupe cleanly), and draining needs to run at
the persist site so the ``session.input.consumed`` event can carry the
cleared id. Both are caller-driven, so the access is explicit.

Draining matches the mirrored text to its entry first and falls back to
FIFO order (oldest first). Native gives no id channel back through the
TUI to correlate the forwarded POST with the mirrored transcript item.
Position alone is not safe either: a pasted message the TUI never
recorded (a host that died mid-paste, a hook that failed closed) leaves
its entry at the head of the queue, and every later message would then
drain the wrong entry — the receipt names the previous message, clients
settle the wrong bubble, and the new message renders twice. So the
persist site drains the oldest entry whose text equals the mirror
(whitespace collapsed; for a message with attachments, the executor's
generated marker lines — one per file block — are dropped from the mirror
first) and reports the older entries it skipped, which the caller
persists as undelivered. Two queued messages with identical text drain in
queue order: text alone cannot tell them apart, so if the older one was
lost the receipt names it and the later one is surfaced as undelivered
at the next match — the only ambiguity this scheme accepts. When
no entry matches — the transcript may still reformat text in ways not
normalized here — the oldest entry is drained, as before, and every entry
still queued is marked uncertain (:func:`mark_uncertain`): the drained
receipt may really have belonged to one of them, so a later match that
jumps over them drains them quietly instead of recording them as
undelivered.

A message the person cancelled with Stop before the agent recorded it would
otherwise be recorded as undelivered at the next match. The interrupt route
flags every entry queued at that moment (:func:`mark_interrupted`): a later
match that jumps over one drains it quietly like an uncertain entry, and it
no longer counts as pending or replays in the snapshot. A mirror carrying its
own text still drains it normally, since the agent did record it after all,
unless a live entry has the same text (a resend after Stop): that one takes
the mirror. The positional drain (:func:`resolve_oldest`) never picks one.

The one imperfect case is interleaving a web-composer message with a
message typed directly in the TUI: the TUI message (which has no pending
entry and matches none) drains the oldest web entry, so that web bubble
briefly disappears and reappears once it persists. It self-heals; the
committed bubble always renders the just-persisted content regardless.

Limitations (identical to :mod:`pending_elicitations`):

* In-memory only; multi-replica Omnigent deploys would each see their own
  slice. Session events are already process-affine (``session_stream``
  is in-process with no replay, and a session's runner relay + SSE
  subscribers live on one process), so this rides the same affinity.
* Entries do not survive an AP-server restart — acceptable, the loss
  is one in-flight message, same as every other AP-side transient.
* At most :data:`_MAX_ENTRIES_PER_CONVERSATION` unheld entries per
  conversation; :func:`record` evicts the oldest unheld entries beyond that
  and never the entry it just recorded. Entries a persist in progress has
  drained with ``hold=True`` keep their slot until :func:`release` (it
  landed) or :func:`restore` (it did not) settles them, so a queue that
  refills during the persist can never discard the entries a failed append
  has to put back; they are a transient overlay of at most one drain, so
  the queue never exceeds twice the cap. A drain reports at most a cap's
  worth of skipped entries, so the persist site's append stays bounded
  even right after a rolled-back drain left the queue over the cap.
* An image-only message has no text to match, so it drains by position;
  behind a stale head
  entry its image can land on the wrong message. This is the positional
  behavior that predates text matching, kept as a known limitation.

A forwarded message the vendor TUI never accepts (runner crash, dropped
keystrokes) is never persisted, so no mirror drains its entry. The next
text-matched mirror skips it (see :func:`resolve_matching_text`) and the
persist site records it as undelivered; :data:`_TTL_S` bounds a ghost no
later message follows: stale entries are evicted lazily on the next
:func:`record` / :func:`snapshot_for` / :func:`resolve_oldest` for the
same conversation.
