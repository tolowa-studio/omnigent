# GitLab merge requests

GitLab sessions show their merge requests in the shared pull request panel,
composer controls, and Canvas cards. The execution host's authenticated `glab`
reads the MR; agent CLI and MCP writes associate it with the session.

## Sub-features

- `summary`: MR identity, nested project, description, comments, and checks.
- `changes`: changed files and diff, with exact-revision expanded context.
- `associations`: link, select, and unlink MRs across projects.
- `partial`: incomplete comments, checks, files, and omitted diff explanations.
- `auth`: missing CLI or denied access retains checkout context and a useful hint.
- `discovery`: glab-configured hosts are recognized without Omnigent configuration,
  including alongside GitHub and Azure DevOps remotes.
- `tracking`: successful mutations persist; reads, comments, failures, and replay
  do not create extra associations.

## How to get to it (user POV)

- `desktop-rail`: open a session's Workspace sidepanel and choose Pull Requests.
- `desktop-composer`: click the MR number beside the session composer.
- `mobile-composer`: tap the MR number to open its full-screen panel.
- `canvas`: enable Canvas, open it, and follow an MR link on a session card.
- `native-hook`: create or update an MR through a Claude or Codex native session.

## Driving it with the repro environment

Preconditions: use the [Verify Omnigent skill](skills/verify-omnigent/SKILL.md)
and start an isolated instance. Browser fixtures replace GitLab resource
responses; they exercise the actual shared UI without contacting GitLab.

- `desktop-rail`, `desktop-composer`, and `mobile-composer`:
  `tests/e2e_ui/gitlab/test_gitlab_panel.py::test_gitlab_panel_summary_and_diff`
  shows `!7`, comments and checks, then opens a readable diff beside an empty
  file's no-text-diff notice and expands unchanged context with the pinned MR
  revisions. Record every variant.
- Associations:
  `tests/e2e_ui/gitlab/test_gitlab_panel.py::test_gitlab_link_select_unlink`
  attaches a second project, changes selection, and removes it.
- Last association removal:
  `tests/e2e_ui/gitlab/test_gitlab_panel.py::test_gitlab_unlink_last_mr_clears_selection`
  removes the final MR through the rail and both composer surfaces, refreshes,
  and verifies no stale selection, error, or fallback link remains. Includes
  an older host's stale selected URL with an empty association list.
- Partial responses:
  `tests/e2e_ui/gitlab/test_gitlab_panel.py::test_gitlab_partial_data_is_visible`
  checks visible summary and diff limitations.
- `canvas`:
  `tests/e2e_ui/gitlab/test_gitlab_panel.py::test_gitlab_canvas_link_uses_merge_request_identity`
  checks the MR number and the exact external destination.
- `native-hook` (own environment):
  `tests/e2e/test_gitlab_pr_tracking_e2e.py::test_native_hook_tracks_gitlab_mr_without_observer_io`
  runs Claude/Codex hook subprocesses through a local relay, persists the MR,
  and reads it through session resources. Covers `glab mr create` on stdout
  and GitLab push-option banners on separate stderr with LF or CRLF line endings.
  The CLI is a deterministic fixture;
  its call log proves the observer made no CLI request.
- Live auth, fork context, and removal persistence: follow
  [the manual verification steps](../docs/GITLAB.md#limits-and-verification)
  using a permitted test GitLab project and execution-host credentials.

## Gotchas

- The shared panel tab and link actions retain the generic Pull Requests wording.
  The provider heading, MR number prefix, external links, and Canvas label must
  use GitLab metadata.
- A private instance is discovered from the execution host's `glab auth login`
  config. Nondefault HTTPS ports stay part of that saved host. SSH ports are separate;
  `api_host` routing remains owned by glab.
- Mocked browser responses prove rendering and interaction, not GitLab access.
  The native hook fixture proves transport and persistence, not vendor services.
- Live tracking proof must launch the native agent itself. Verify its `glab`
  login, then create MRs in another worktree using both `glab mr create` and
  `git push -o merge_request.create`. Neither should need branch inference or
  manual linking. Host-to-runner config forwarding alone does not prove the
  native child received the CLI config location.
- Keep evidence outside the tracked tree. Canvas is gated by its feature flag;
  desktop sidepanel proof does not cover the mobile drawer or Canvas link.
