# Composer

The composer is where a user writes a message and chooses how the agent runs
it. It appears in two places that look alike but are separate surfaces: the
in-session composer at the bottom of a chat, and the new-session composer on
the landing page. Both show a model/effort pill with a hover tooltip, open a
configuration menu for harness, model, reasoning effort, and permission mode,
and accept attachments and slash commands. The in-session composer also queues
and steers messages while the agent is busy.

## Sub-features

- `pill-tooltip`: hovering the pill shows one tooltip with Harness, Model, and
  Connection rows (plus effort when the harness has it).
- `pill-tooltip-suppressed`: the tooltip stays hidden while the model picker is
  open and does not reappear when the picker closes.
- `pill-opens-config`: clicking anywhere on the highlighted pill label opens the
  configuration menu.
- `model-picker`: lists the host's live model catalog, highlights the current
  model, and keeps the selection. States: catalog loading, delayed catalog,
  alias vs. full model ID, refused switch (the pill keeps the applied model).
- `effort-picker`: reasoning effort for harnesses that support it (Codex, Claude,
  Pi). States: available, unavailable placeholder, max/ultra levels, refused
  change (the pill keeps the applied level).
- `effort-terminal-mirror`: an effort change typed in the Codex terminal shows
  in the composer, and a composer pick is not reverted by later terminal turns.
- `permission-mode`: the harness's native approval modes; the current mode is
  marked and the choice persists.
- `slash-menu`: typing `/` opens commands and skills with keyboard navigation.
- `attachments`: attach button, paste, and drop onto the transcript; chips can
  be removed. State: unsupported file type rejected without losing the message.
- `send-shortcut`: Enter or Mod+Enter, chosen in settings; only one gesture sends.
  Shift+Enter and Alt/Option+Enter insert a newline in both composers.
- `queue-and-steer`: messages sent while the agent is busy wait in a queue and
  can be steered into the running turn.
- `browser-pointer-queue`: desktop Design-mode instructions follow the same queue
  and always-steer preference, keeping their element screenshots.
- `pi-compact`: `/compact` follows the normal queue/Always steer preference.
  Send now interrupts the turn and compacts. During compaction, queued messages
  wait in the web queue; immediate sends are retained by the Pi integration.
- `draft-persistence`: unsent text survives arriving messages and prompts.
- `delivered-send-recovery`: a sent message stays out of the composer when its
  HTTP acknowledgement is lost. Delivery during draft restoration clears the
  untouched draft; user edits remain.
- `import-bundle`: Create custom agent → Import bundle installs a `.tar.gz` agent
  bundle and selects it. States: import in flight (Cancel and Create locked),
  rejected bundle, imported agent missing from the refreshed list, and hidden on
  a server without agent install.
- `mobile-labels`: on narrow screens labels collapse to icons without
  overlapping the stop button.

## How to get to it (user POV)

**In-session composer** (open any session):

- Hover the model/effort pill to see the tooltip; click it to open configuration.
- In configuration, open the model picker, the effort picker, or the permission
  mode menu.
- For a Codex session, open the Terminal view and change effort there, then
  return to Chat.
- Type `/` in the message box; attach files with the button, by paste, or by
  dropping them on the transcript.
- Send while the agent is working to queue a message, then steer it.

**Desktop browser pointer** (open a session in the desktop app):

- Choose **+ → Browser** to open a Browser soft tab, navigate to a page, enable
  Design mode, and click an element. Type an instruction in the floating popup
  and use Send or Enter.
- Change Settings → Always steer to choose whether busy-session follow-ups
  queue or send immediately. Existing queued messages retain FIFO ordering.

**New-session composer** (landing page, or New session):

- From any page, press ⌘/Ctrl+Alt+N to open and focus a clean new-session
  composer.
- Hover the model/effort pill to see the tooltip.
- Pick a harness, then open its configuration for model, effort (Codex, Claude,
  Pi), and permission mode before the session exists.
- Attach files or type `/` before the first send.
- Open the agent picker's custom agents, then Create custom agent → Import
  bundle: pick a `.tar.gz` agent bundle. It installs, closes the dialog, and
  selects the agent, which stays listed after a reload. A rejected bundle (for
  example a server agent's name) keeps the dialog open with the server's reason.

**Mobile** (either composer on a phone-sized viewport): the same controls with
collapsed labels.

## Driving it with the repro environment

Preconditions: a running instance (`verify-env start`, then `verify-env
doctor`), the built web UI, and mock replies configured for any journey that
sends a message. Run e2e tests through the instance:

```sh
verify-env run -- python -m pytest <test> --ui-skip-build --video=on \
  --output="$VERIFY_EVIDENCE/composer"
```

Tests under `tests/browser_ui/` stub every backend call and need no instance:
`uv run pytest <test> --browser-ui-skip-build --video=on --output="$VERIFY_EVIDENCE/composer"`.

  (runs with zero and one turn).
- **`pill-tooltip`, new-session composer:** no browser-level coverage; the web

  page, hover the pill, and expect the same styled rows as in a session, not a
  plain browser title tooltip.

- **`model-picker`, `effort-picker`, refused change:** the rollback cases in
  `web/src/store/chatStore.test.ts` and the composer case in
  `web/src/pages/ChatPage.composer.test.tsx` (`pnpm --dir web test`). Manually,
  pick another effort in a Codex session right after Start session, while the

  `tests/e2e_ui/chat/test_composer_bulk_steer.py::test_bulk_steer_retries_the_whole_queue`
- **`browser-pointer-queue`, desktop:** manually hold an agent turn open, then
  send a normal composer follow-up and two pointer instructions (Send and Enter).
  With Always steer off, all three stay queued and the popup says "Queued for
  agent." After the turn ends, verify FIFO delivery and each pointer screenshot.
  Repeat in a fresh session with Always steer on: both entry points send while
  busy and the pointer popup says "Sent to agent." If older messages are already
  queued, new pointer instructions must join them even with Always steer on.
- **`pi-compact`:** in a Pi session, start a long turn, type `/comp`, press Tab,
  then Enter. With Always steer off, confirm `/compact` queues; use Send now to
  interrupt and compact. With Always steer on and an empty queue, Enter should
  compact immediately. During compaction, send a follow-up in each mode: normal
  queue mode keeps its queue row; Always steer hands it to Pi. Both should run
  once after compaction. Repeat the queued flow while viewing another session.
- **`draft-persistence`:**
  `tests/e2e_ui/chat/test_draft_survives_incoming_messages.py::test_mid_typing_answer_survives_arriving_prompt`
- **`delivered-send-recovery`, in-session composer (desktop and mobile):**
  `tests/e2e_ui/mobile/test_composer_after_unacked_send.py::test_composer_stays_empty_after_delivered_but_unacked_send`
  runs with a phone viewport. Run the same lost-ack journey at a desktop viewport
  for the desktop entry point. The restore/delivery ordering and preservation of
  user edits are covered in `web/src/pages/ChatPage.composer.test.tsx`.
- **`new-session-hotkey`:**
  `tests/e2e_ui/sessions/test_new_session_hotkey.py::test_new_session_hotkey_from_focused_composer`
- **`import-bundle`:** no browser-level coverage; the web unit tests for the
  Create custom agent and new-session dialogs cover it. Manually: open the agent
  picker's custom agents, then Create custom agent → Import bundle, and pick a
  `.tar.gz` of an agent directory. Expect the dialog to close with the agent
  selected, and the agent still listed after a reload. A bundle named like a
  server agent keeps the dialog open with the server's reason.
- **`mobile-labels`, new-session composer:**
  `tests/e2e_ui/mobile/test_composer_model_label_stop_overlap.py::test_new_session_composer_collapses_labels_to_icons_on_mobile`

## Gotchas

- The in-session and new-session composers are different surfaces. A change to
  the pill, tooltip, configuration menu, or effort picker in one does not reach
  the other. Verify both, plus the mobile layout.
- "New session" in a test name can mean a session with no turns yet, not the
  landing page. Check which surface the test opens.
- Tooltip changes need a hover after the picker closes, not only on first load.
  A tooltip that returns after clicking away is a regression.
- Effort exists only for some harnesses. Check at least one harness with effort
  and one without, since the pill and tooltip rows change.
- A refused model or effort change rolls the pill back to the applied setting.
  There is no separate error control to inspect.
- Codex effort can change from the terminal as well as the composer. Confirm the
  terminal command actually landed before blaming the mirror.
- The mock environment configures Claude and Codex only. Other harnesses'
  catalogs need real CLIs or credentials.
